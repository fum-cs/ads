# About the course


This website is devoted for two simultaneously courses [Algorithms for Data Science](ADS.md)(ADS), and [Mathematical Foundations of Data Science](MFDS.md)(MFDS), which provide a comprehensive, in-depth overview of data mining, machine learning, and statistics, offering solid guidance for students, researchers, and practitioners. The website lays the foundations of data analysis, pattern mining, clustering, classification, and regression, with a focus on the algorithms and the underlying algebraic, geometric, and probabilistic concepts.

<!-- This courses covers the fundamental algorithms and mathematics in data mining and machine learning; form the basis of data science, utilizing automated methods to analyze patterns and models for all kinds of data in applications ranging from scientific discovery to business analytics.  -->

### <a name="Four-Written-Exams"></a>Four Written Exams:
TBA

## <a name="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites:
General mathematical sophistication; and a solid understanding of Algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Probability Theory, at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level, or equivalent.
<!-- The used concepts of statistics and mathematics are taught simultaneously with this course by Dr. Fakoor in the Mathematical Foundations of Data Science course. -->


<!-- ## <a name="Topics"></a>Topics:
Have a look at some reports of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or Stanford students ([CS224N](http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/2015/), [CS224D](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports_2016.html)) to get some general inspiration. -->

## <a name="Account"></a>Account:
It is necessary to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to share your projects. It offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts. Github is like the hammer in your toolbox, therefore, you need to have it!

## <a name="Academic-Honor-Code"></a>Academic Honor Code:
Honesty and integrity are vital elements of the academic works. All your submitted assignments must be entirely your own (or your own group's).

We will follow the standard of Faculty of Mathematical Sciences approach: 
* You should not use code of others or be looking at code of others when you write your own: You can talk to people but have to write your own solution/code
*  You can talk to others about the algorithm(s) to be used to solve a homework problem; as long as you then mention their name(s) on the work you submit

## <a name="Questions"></a>Questions?
I will be having office hours for this course on Monday (10:00 AM--11:30 AM). If this is not convenient, email me at m.amintoosi@um.ac.ir or talk to me after class.
